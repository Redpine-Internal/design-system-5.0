    verdict: PASS
    score: 8.75
    summary: |
      The Brad Frost Design System v5 agent is a comprehensive, well-structured agent definition
      with exceptional persona depth. The research-grounded DNA fusion (voice_dna + thinking_dna)
      with 22 source citations sets a high bar for agent authenticity. 50 commands across 20 phases
      cover the full design system lifecycle. Expert routing to 6 specialist DNAs is fully functional
      with all paths verified. Two minor warnings relate to unverifiable task file dependencies and
      missing example coverage for new v5.0 features. No security issues detected.
